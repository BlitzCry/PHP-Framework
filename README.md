## Components of the Framework

- [x] **Router:**
  - [x] Handle incoming requests.
  - [x] Direct requests to the appropriate controller or action.

- [x] **Controller:**
  - [x] Contain application logic.

  - [x] Receive input from the controller.
  - [x] Present the user interface.

- [x] **Template Engine:**
  - [x] Structure and organize the presentation layer.
  - [x] Separate HTML from PHP logic.

- [x] **Middleware:**
  - [x] Handle tasks like authentication, authorization, logging, and input validation.

- [x] **Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL) or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):**
  - [x] Simplify database interactions by providing an abstraction layer.

- [x] **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - [x] Manage user authentication (login).
  - [x] Implement authorization mechanisms.

- [x] **Routing:**
  - [x] Define the URL structure.
  - [x] Map requests to controllers and actions.

- [x] **Validation and Form Handling:**
  - [x] Validate user input.
  - [x] Handle form submissions securely.

- [x] **Error Handling and Logging:**
  - [x] Manage errors gracefully.
  - [x] Log information for debugging and monitoring.

- [x] **Configuration Management:**
  - [x] Handle configuration settings for the application.

- [x] **Dependency Injection:**
  - [x] Implement the design pattern allowing objects to be injected into a class.

- [x] **Testing Support:**
  - [x] Include tools and conventions for unit testing and test-driven development.

- [x] **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Support:**
  - [x] Allow developers to interact with the application through the command line.
