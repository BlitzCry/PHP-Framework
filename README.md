# PHP Framework Development Roadmap

## Components of the Framework

- [ ] **Router:**
  - [ ] Handle incoming requests.
  - [ ] Direct requests to the appropriate controller or action.

- [ ] **Controller:**
  - [ ] Contain application logic.
  - [ ] Handle user input.
  - [ ] Communicate with the model.

- [ ] **Model:**
  - [ ] Represent data and business logic.
  - [ ] Interact with the database.
  - [ ] Communicate with the controller.

- [ ] **View:**
  - [ ] Display data to the user.
  - [ ] Receive input from the controller.
  - [ ] Present the user interface.

- [ ] **Template Engine:**
  - [ ] Structure and organize the presentation layer.
  - [ ] Separate HTML from PHP logic.

- [ ] **Middleware:**
  - [ ] Handle tasks like authentication, authorization, logging, and input validation.

- [ ] **Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL) or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):**
  - [ ] Simplify database interactions by providing an abstraction layer.

- [ ] **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - [ ] Manage user authentication (login).
  - [ ] Implement authorization mechanisms.

- [ ] **Routing:**
  - [ ] Define the URL structure.
  - [ ] Map requests to controllers and actions.

- [ ] **Validation and Form Handling:**
  - [ ] Validate user input.
  - [ ] Handle form submissions securely.

- [ ] **Error Handling and Logging:**
  - [ ] Manage errors gracefully.
  - [ ] Log information for debugging and monitoring.

- [ ] **Configuration Management:**
  - [ ] Handle configuration settings for the application.

- [ ] **Dependency Injection:**
  - [ ] Implement the design pattern allowing objects to be injected into a class.

- [ ] **Testing Support:**
  - [ ] Include tools and conventions for unit testing and test-driven development.

- [ ] **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Support:**
  - [ ] Allow developers to interact with the application through the command line.
